<p>I am 28 years old and currently residing in Denver, Co with my partner in crime Xochitl. That's my one year old Dutch Shepherd who has poked her nose on my keyboard at least twice while writing this. This blog is my journey on becoming a Software Engineer at Flatiron School from start to finish.</p>
