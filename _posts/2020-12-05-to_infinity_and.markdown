... BEYOND!


Let me start off by saying 2020 has been quite a year for everyone! For me, it seems to have been my Murphy's Law year. 

*Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.*

The beginning of the year felt promising. I was able to visit some very close friends in Mexico for my birthday in February and it was amazing. Being half Mexican, I always wanted to touch the land of my ancestors and finally being able to do so after 28 years was magical. 

Then, I got into a car accident while working. I was a delivery driver and while working a late night shift, like always, I had the unfortunate luck of getting t-boned by a driver who ran a red light. Go figure.

I started my journey with becoming a Software Engineer late 2019 so the ball was already rolling. I had worked up a whole plan on how I was going to start school for it and still work part-time. I even decided I'd start after the Coachella Festival that I work every year in Cali. But a week after my accident, the lockdowns happened. I had to pause everything, even my doctor appointments. Only to realize when things started easing up that I'd been so traumatized by the entire situation that I could no longer drive. 

So here I am, back at my Dad's house,  unemployed (but not really), struck with depression, anxiety, pretty damaged physically and ontop of everything I have become dependent all over again. If there's a rock bottom, I definitely hit it this year. Afraid to drive? But I loved driving! This feeling so foreign to me that this is the second time I've admitted it out loud. The other time was to my therapist. To wrap all of the chaos up, I've yet to receive pay from being out of work. Again, the accident happened in March and I'm writing this in December. I'm sure you can imagine the toll this has taken on me.

However, Flatiron School was like a green lightsaber waving within the fog. For once, I actually had time that wouldn't be spent working two jobs. So I took the plunge, applied and well, here I am. A Full Stack Software Engineer. To say this was a difficult journey would be an understatement, and in that same breathe, I wouldn't have done it any other way. I needed Flatiron School for the skills I learned in programming but also to learn more about myself. To realize how resillent I truly am.

Now, it was small, but you may have noticed I said I "was" working as a delivery driver. I'm speaking it into existence that the next chapter of my life will no longer have room for manual labor or small jobs like those I've done before. I'm a Software Engineer and it's time that I regarded myself as such. It may be the true beginning of my journey but I look forward to it with so much joy in my heart.
