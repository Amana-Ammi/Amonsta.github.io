As I sat working on my first project, I had one consistent thought.

“I’m really doing this! I am coding!”

Now don’t get me wrong, I got stuck PLENTY of times. However, I never stopped. I worked through despite seeing error after error because I knew I could make it work, and I did. When I couldn’t wrap my head around a solution, I reached out to previous material and most importantly, my classmates.

The hardest part of my CLI project was honestly finding an API that worked well and that was also interesting. My goal was to find an interesting API that way it’d be easier for me to understand exactly what I wanted to get out of it. The last thing I wanted was to worry about understanding the information I was pulling while also writing code for it. I started with music API’s. Fail. The infamous Marvel API (that I also spent too much time trying to get working). Finally, I landed a Marijuana Strain API that was well organized and had a working key without hoops to jump through. Very fitting since I live in Colorado.

So I set off and built my project. What I love about this project is how well it brought all the curriculum to this point into play. I actually felt prepared and a month ago I would’ve laughed at the thought. Though this project may seem simple on paper, I’m imagining all the ways one can use this concept for even bigger applications. I’m truly looking forward to future projects and growth from all of us in the cohort.
