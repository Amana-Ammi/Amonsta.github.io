If I reflect on 10 years ago, I was 18 and going straight into higher education from high school. I was confused and felt pressure on deciding my entire life with my major. I was stuck between being a creative in school and following a mechanical engineering path. I chose art, well, because of imposter syndrome(I didn't think I was smart enough to be a mechanical engineer). 

Fast forward to 2020, I've been working as security for concert venues for about 4 years now. I even do work at Coachella every year. To supplement income I also work as a delivery driver. 

Although, music is a huge part of my life, Iâ€™d rather enjoy it on a different and much safer scale.'m learning Software Engineering because I want to take control of my life and my career. Building and creating are defining pieces of myself that I wish to mold into something greater. I embrace the challenges as well as the small victories, because they matter too. Here's to my journey!
