Well, not really. However, Rails does make it look easy and in this post I'll explain a few of my favorite error methods.

If you're reading this blog entry, chances are that you've encountered at least a few error messages while browsing the internet. For me, probably a few.. hundred ha. No matter how many times I think my password is going to cement itself into my brain, it doesn't. So you can imagine that a lot of the errors I have encountered involved my User logins. Whether it's my Petsmart account or even my Insagram, I'm usually met with an "Email/Password combination invalid. Please try again" message flashing across the screen and then I send myself an email, reset it, and start the cycle all over again the next day.

As annoying as it all may seem, it's extremely necessary. I'd rather have a hard time logging into my own account than give a hacker or anyone else open-door service to my accounts.
